**Research Interests**

My research addresses the intersection of self-care and religion in
contemporary North India. The aim of this work is to show how 21^st^
century pursuits of wellbeing not only span religious and medical
institutions, but also disrupt the integrity of either as discrete
fields. Currently, I am investigating both the patrons of Baba Ramdev
and the members of the Gayatri Pariwar. My concerns interface Religion
and Medical Anthropology.
