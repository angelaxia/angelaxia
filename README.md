This is my professional website. I built it through HUGO with the [Freelancer theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-freelancer-theme)


ToDo:
 - I want to be able to process my CV changes from the "CV" project so that they are reflected in the CV partial of my professional website, including an updated PDF file.
   - to do this:
     - edit html template
       - make it resemble a partial
       - Publications should have hanging indents
