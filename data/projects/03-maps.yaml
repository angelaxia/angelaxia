  During the course of my dissertation fieldwork, I began to reflect on how I and my research subjects were inhabiting a city and country much larger than we are. This led me to build a series of maps anchored to several fieldwork experiences, initially as a note-taking aid.

  Although these maps are a work in progress, I invite you to explore several of the places where I conducted fieldwork in 2019-2020.

  (Please note that these maps are designed for viewing on PC only.)
