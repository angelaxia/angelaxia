  I am currently investigating several products and services offered by three Hindu institutions in Mathura that participate in what has been called India's religious market. The conjunction of liberal economic reforms with new technologies of manufacture, distribution, and advertising has facilitated what Lise McKean (1996) terms "divine enterprise" and Meera Nanda (2011) calls the "god market." Both scholars warn that a capitalistic economic ideology has made popular Hinduism into a matter of consumer culture and allowed powerful people and institutions to twist religion to suit fiscal and political ends. Yet I reject their conclusion that the logic of capitalism is the only way to characterize the relationships between contemporary North Indians and the products and practices offered by Hindu institutions.

  Instead, I pursue a multi-scalar ethnography of _care products_, one subset of the goods and services that several such institutions offer, with an eye to determining for which reasons, by which means, and in which ways Indians incorporate them into their lives. I attempt to answer the following questions: How do the care products promoted by Hindu institutions work, and how are they made to work, for contemporary Indians? If commodified Hindu goods and services are significant in excess of their consumption, what configurations of Indian life do they impact, and how? In answering these questions, I attempt to do more than identify the growing reach of so-called global markets or the insidious intentions of religious entrepreneurs; instead, I evaluate how one facet of commodified religion continues to reshape the relationships between Indians, popular Hinduism, and the state.
