description: My current research addresses self-help and -care in contemporary North India in order to demonstrate three things. First, despite their dismissal by many religious figures and medical professionals, self-help and -care have come to be prominent components of contemporary Indian religion and healing. Second, Indian self-help is not simply a *deśī* version of New Age consumer culture; rather, it emerges out of the transformation of Indian medical services into pharmaceuticals, the Gandhian legacy of self-uplift (*sarvodaya*) projects, and attitudes toward religious nationalism (both critical and protective). Third, insofar as self-help entangles medical, religious, political, and environmental concerns, the viability of a market idiom to describe religious belonging in India today must be evaluated.<br><br>To this end my research investigates two contemporary Hindu groups. On the one hand, the members of the All World Gayatri Pariwar pursue wellbeing through community-oriented social service, several religious rites that they claim have scientific backing, and the life and works of their founder Shriram Sharma, the presumed author of some 3200 books. On the other hand, the customers and patrons of Baba Ramdev – whose Patanjali company deals in everything from yoga to instant noodles to swadeshi SIM cards – tune-in to his 4 A.M. yoga broadcast (after using his toothpaste) on the premise that his products contain bio-moral goodness.
