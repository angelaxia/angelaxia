My current research addresses self-help and -care as practiced by two Hindu groups in contemporary North India: the All World Gayatri Pariwar (AWGP), an organization that pursues wellbeing through community-oriented social service, several religious rites that they claim have scientific backing, and the life and works of their founder Shriram Sharma, the presumed author of some 3200 books; and the patrons of the products and services of Baba Ramdev, whose Patanjali company deals in everything from yoga to instant noodles to swadeshi SIM cards. To this end, I work between Religion and Medical Anthropology.<br><br>I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Religion Department of Columbia University."
